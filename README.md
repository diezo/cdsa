# Data Stuctures &amp; Algorithms in C
This repository contains my progress on DSA in C.

## Stack
Check the ```/stack``` directory for implementations.
- **Static Stack** - Has fixed size, can't expand beyond that.
- **Dynamic Stack** - Allocates and deallocates memory based on usage.

## Linked List
Check the ```/linked-list``` directory for implementations.
- **Singly Linked-List** - Uses single pointer.
- **Doubly Linked-List** - Uses two pointers.
- **Singly Circular Linked-List** - Uses single pointer and the last node points to the first node.
- **Doubly Circular Linked-List** - Uses two pointers and the last and first nodes are linked to each other.

## Queue
Check the ```/queue``` directory for implementations.
- **Static Queue** - Has fixed size, can't expand beyond that.
- **Dynamic Queue** - Uses doubly linked-list for a dynamic implementation.
